# Blog built on Django Framework
I built a fully functional website with GUI for posting new posts. <br />
I added an admin panel at /admin. (user: admin, pw:123456).<br />
The posts shows in the main page NEWEST first.
 

 ## HOW-TO run the server
 download the zip file, extract and navigate to it.
 
 in cmd run:
 
     python manage.py runserver
 
 then go to the default port on the localhost which is:
 
     localhost:8000
