# django_project
 The idea is to create and explore new django features.
 
 Built the admin at /admin with a generic user admin and pw 123456.  
 
 Also manage to create a page for /about with correct routing.
 
 Added the functionality to add posts from the admin control panel with the approriate fields.
 

 ## HOW-TO run the server
 download the zip file, extract and navigate to it.
 
 in cmd run:
 
     python manage.py runserver
 
 then go to the default port on the localhost which is:
 
     localhost:8000
